### Back-End Manual Installation

It is recomended to install the backend first, make sure you have Python 3.10, virtualenv or pipenv and a database engine (Posgresql 14 recomended)

1. Install the python packages: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a .env file based on the .env.example: `$ cp .env.example .env`
3. Install your database engine and create your database, depending on your database you have to create a DATABASE_URL .env variable with one of the possible values, make sure yo replace the valudes with your database information

| Engine    | DATABASE_URL                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite    | sqlite:////test.db                                  |
| MySQL     | mysql://username:password@localhost:port/example    |
| Postgress | postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/example |

4. In SQL directory exits a dump for POSTGRESQL, rename the extensi√≥n to sql before import to your database
